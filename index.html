    <h2>About Me <a id="About-Me"></a></h2>
    <p>
      My name is Louis Gazo. I was born and raised in Northern Vermont by a
      blue-collared family. This family culture along with being the middle
      child developed my work ethic, attention to detail, and desire to strive
      for my best. I love playing soccer, enjoy fishing, hunting, triathlons,
      the gym, and nature. I like to explore and push my limits whether that be
      mentally or physically. This course will is a challenege for me as I face
      my fear of coding, but must do so in order to push the limits and
      boundaries.

        title="Summer with Vermont Green FC"
        height="200"
        width="300"
      />
      Recently, I spent the summer as a financial analyst intern for Morgan
      Stanley, started my own company that helps prospective student-athletes
      and college coaches with the recruiting process, played with a USLII
      soccer team, trained and completed two triathlons. 2022 was a successful
      year, but I plan to push myself even further in 2023.
    </p>
    <p>
      I chose Babson College
      <a href="https://www.Babson.edu"> Babson College</a> to be challeneged. I
      intially studied and played soccer at the Univeristy of Vermont, yet after
      the pandemic I realized I needed to change my path. From the shortlist of
      schools I considered, Babson provided me with a new opportunity and
      community that pushes eachother. This internal friendly competition I
      noted while visitng Babson pursuaded my decision to come here and become a
      better verison of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I chose Babson because I wanted to pursue one of the best learning
      environments. Being able to learn from others and be pushed by my peers is
      what I am grateful for. When I graduate, I am not exactly sure what I want
      to be. However, I have a wide array of skills to pursue whatever I desire.

    <h2>My Hobbies <a id="My-Hobbies"></a></h2>

    <p>
      I have a wide range of hobbies. Contrary to what one might believe, I
      enjoy chess, puzzles, listening to country music, and going on great
      hikes. In addition to previously mentioned hobbies, I enjoy waking up on
      weekend mornings to watch my favorite soccer team in the English Premier
      League,
      <a href="https://www.southamptonfc.com/">Southampton FC</a> , play as well
      as other teams. Essentially my hobbies and interest involve nature,
      sports, and critical thinking games. I have been referred to as a "yellow
      lab" mentality and energy, but I do enjoy my down time and reflection in
      regards to hobbies. At Babson I live in the library, gym, and frequent the
      on-campus coffee shops for fuel. Working out with others and helping them
      become comfrtable in the gym is a goal of mine. As well as providing
      resources they can enhance their knowledge about for health and fitness
      goals.
