          Every stadium is different. The ranking system incorporates four key
          metrics. The atmosphere, viewing angles, architecture, and surrounding
          area. These four metrics incorporate a hollisitc perspective at futbol
          stadiums. They are beauty, art, economic staples, and create a local
          clture. The atmosphere includes the fan culture, chants, and proximity
          to the game pitch within the stadium. Viewing includes the ability to
          see the game and any obstructions or odd angles. Architecture analyzes
          the building's design and creative features that provide a taste of
          art for all futbol fans. Finally, the surrounding area incorporates
          the town or city and whether this improves or decreases the value of
          the stadium. It is difficult to properly asses a stadium on these four
          metrics, but is conducted through experiences, references, research,
          and football knowledge.

          Being in the top 12 for stadiums in Europe is a feat nonetheless.
          However, there are a few reasons for placing Stade Louis at twelth
          compared to the other stadiums listed. The architecture is marvelous,
          images from the mountaintops, the unqiue rooftop design screams
          Monaco, and the structure within the stadium boosts the overall
          designs. The atmoshpere is vibrant, yet the biggest downside is the
          track that surrounds the field. This track is the biggest downside to
          any footballer or fan. It creates seperation between the fans and
          players which negatively impacts the atmosphere. Due to strong
          architecture the viewing is one the best - no columns, nets, or other
          obstructions for the fans. Perfect ciruclation allows for fans to
          catch the action from any angle. Fianlly, the surrounding area for
          Monaco is stunning. This stadium has very little downside other than
          the track and the expense associated within Monaco. However,
          everything about this stadium puts it on the list of the 12 best
          stadiums in Europe to go visit!

          The Sukru Saracoglu Stadium in Turkey is one of the country's most
          iconic football arenas. It has been the home of Fenerbahce SK since
          1908, and the stadium has undergone several renovations to improve its
          facilities and enhance the overall fan experience. The ranking system
          incorporates four key metrics that can be used to assess the stadium's
          value: atmosphere, viewing angles, architecture, and surrounding area.
          The atmosphere at the Sukru Saracoglu Stadium is known to be electric,
          with passionate fans who create an intense and supportive environment.
          The viewing angles are also impressive, with excellent sightlines and
          clear views of the pitch. The stadium's architecture is striking and
          modern, with unique design features that provide a taste of art for
          all football fans. The downside to this stadium when compared to the
          remaining 10 stadiums, is the compeititon within the stadium and
          potential danger once outside the secure stadium. Nonetheless, the
          Sukru Saracoglu Stadium is a top-tier football stadium that
          exemplifies the beauty, art, economic staples, and local culture that
          make football such a beloved sport.

          The Arena Nationala in Bucharest, Romania, is a shining example of a
          modern football stadium that excels in all four key metrics used to
          assess its value. The stadium's atmosphere is electric, with
          passionate fans filling the stands and creating an unforgettable
          experience for all in attendance. The viewing angles are outstanding,
          with clear sightlines and no obstructions, ensuring that every fan can

          modern, featuring state-of-the-art facilities that cater to all fan
          needs, from seating to concessions. The surrounding area is bustling
          with life, offering an array of dining and entertainment options that
          add to the overall experience. The combination of these four metrics
          creates a truly holistic perspective of the stadium, demonstrating its
          value not just as a sporting venue but as a cultural and economic
          staple of the city. The downside to Arena Nationale is the lack of
          history within the stadium as it was built in 2011. These stadiums are
          history caputured in time and a reason why Arena Nationale is 10th.
          Overall, an amazing stadium, place, and a landmark to stop in Europe.

          proximity and similarity to other English stadiums is the reason I put
          a few other European stadiums above Anfield. Overall, Anfield is an
          exceptional stadium that provides a comprehensive experience for
